        <b style="color: darkturquoise"><u>Click Market</u></b> is an online platform for photographers to gain global exposure, 
        test their work, and earn money through licensing and brand partnership opportunities.
        It facilitates direct connections between photographers and clients. As of September 2018, 
        the site has 15 million users. On July 1, 2018, Getty Images became 500px's exclusive 
        distribution partner for licensing outside China, as per its existing agreements with VCG.
        As a result, 500px Marketplace was shut down on June 30, 2018. The service also discontinued 
        support for publicly-licensed images (such as Creative Commons), citing that the function was 
        underused.On April 12, 2012, 500px's Terms of Service rose to the top of popular site Hacker News, 
        garnering attention for legalese on the left-hand side of the page and summing up the legalese 
        basic points on the right-hand side. The resulting discussion on the Terms was mixed, with 
        positive feedback such as 'awesome' and 'one of the cleanest in the industry'
        alongside negative feedback that believes 500px may have put themselves at undue risk. On January 21, 
        2013, Apple removed 500px's iPad app from its store, citing concerns of nudity available via the app.
         Apple restored the app on January 29, following the release of a new version with a "Mature 17+ rating" 
         and a report button.
